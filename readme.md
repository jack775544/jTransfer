#  jTransfer

An sftp client made in java built for the web browser.
This is a continuation of the [Browser Transfer](https://github.com/jack775544/browser-transfer) project.

Installation
------------
    ant
The resulting file will be generated in /_project_root_/out/artifacts/jTransfer/jTransfer.war
Place this in the tomcat webapps root directory (default is _/var/www_ or _/var/www/webapp_)

Notes
---
By default zones at UQ have outgoing connections from port 22 blocked, this means that this will not work on the normal settings! To get port 22 unblocked on the UQ Zones, contact the ITIG helpdesk for assistance.
